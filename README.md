# Evolutionary Robotics

Which robot, a hexapod or quadruped, evolves to move further? To answer this question, I used PyBullet physics engine to compare the evolution of a Quadruped and Hexapod robot over the same evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm gives higher fitness scores to robots that moved far and in regular motion.

Figure 2 shows the results of the A/B Test. As mentioned, there is three curves that represent each robot. The Quadruped’s lines are different shades of blue and the Hexapod’s lines are different shades of red.
Based on this graph, I cannot draw conclusions as to which robot evolved to move further. Although the Quadruped has a mean fitness curve greater than the Hexapod, there is an overlap between the Quadruped’s mean minus standard deviation curve and mean curve and the Hexapod’s mean plus standard deviation curve and mean curve.
